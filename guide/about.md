3. ABOUT / SKILLS — The Skill Graph (Not a List)
PHASE 0 — Core Philosophy (Read First)

Goal
Skills are not labels — they are systems that interact.

Hard Rules

❌ No bullet lists

❌ No progress bars

❌ No “80% React”

✅ Skills exist as nodes in a system

✅ Understanding is demonstrated through interaction

If it can be skimmed, it fails.

PHASE 1 — Scene & Layout Foundation
Task 1.1 — Create the 3D Skill Space

Tech

React Three Fiber

Full viewport or near-full section

Camera:

Perspective

Slight distance (graph fully visible)

Background

Dark / neutral

No distracting environment maps

Focus stays on nodes

Task 1.2 — Define Skill Nodes

Each node represents one skill:

Initial Set

React

GSAP

WebGL

Performance

Accessibility

Node Properties

{
  id: "gsap",
  label: "GSAP",
  position: Vector3,
  connections: ["react", "scroll", "webgl"],
  usageFrequency: number
}

PHASE 2 — Graph Topology (Not Random Placement)
Task 2.1 — Relationship Mapping

Rules

Nodes are positioned based on conceptual proximity

Related skills are closer

Distant concepts are farther apart

Examples

GSAP ↔ React (close)

WebGL ↔ Performance (close)

Accessibility ↔ React (medium)

This makes the graph semantic, not decorative.

Task 2.2 — Connection System

Connections

Lines, beams, or subtle energy links

Rendered efficiently

Visual strength reflects relationship depth

PHASE 3 — Physics Engine (Core Differentiator 🔥)
Task 3.1 — Verlet Physics Simulation

Purpose

Nodes behave like living entities

Motion feels organic, not scripted

Behaviors

Attraction between related nodes

Soft constraints (no jitter)

Stable at rest

Task 3.2 — Hover-Based Physics Interaction

On Hover

Target node expands

Connected nodes are attracted toward it

Motion ripples outward

Rules

Physics-driven, not GSAP-only

No teleporting

Motion decays naturally

PHASE 4 — Interaction Layer
Task 4.1 — Hover Interaction

Hover Effects

Node scale increases

Glow or emissive boost

Label clarity increases

Acceptance Criteria

User immediately understands “this is interactive”

No tooltip spam

Task 4.2 — Click Interaction (Inline Expansion)

On Click

Node becomes “active”

Inline panel opens within the 3D context

No route change

No modal takeover

PHASE 5 — Skill Deep Dive Panels
Task 5.1 — GSAP Example Panel (Reference Implementation)

When clicking GSAP, show:

1. ScrollTrigger Demo

Live scroll interaction

Visual scrub indicator

2. Timeline Visualization

Horizontal timeline

Playhead movement

Labels and stagger markers

3. Performance Comparison

RAF loop example

ScrollTrigger-controlled example

Frame stability comparison

Rule
This is not text-heavy — it’s demonstrative.

Task 5.2 — Other Skills Follow Same Pattern

Each skill must include:

Conceptual explanation

Live or visual demo

System-level insight

PHASE 6 — Scroll Interaction
Task 6.1 — Scroll-Based Graph Motion

Behavior

Subtle rotation of entire graph

Slight parallax shift

No dizziness

Rules

Scroll enhances spatial understanding

Does not steal control

PHASE 7 — Performance Architecture
Task 7.1 — GPU Instancing

Why

Multiple nodes

Smooth physics

Stable FPS

Implementation

Single geometry

Instanced meshes

Minimal draw calls

Task 7.2 — Pulse Based on Real Usage

Data Source

Actual project usage

Weighted frequency

Behavior

Nodes pulse subtly

Frequently used skills pulse more often

Pulse synced to internal clock

Result
Your experience is measurable, not claimed.

PHASE 8 — Accessibility & Safety
Task 8.1 — Reduced Motion Mode

When enabled

Physics damping increased

Pulsing disabled

Camera movement minimized

Task 8.2 — Interaction Alternatives

Keyboard navigation between nodes

Focus outlines

Screen reader-friendly descriptions

PHASE 9 — Why This Wins (Validation Layer)

Judges experience

Skills as a living system

Real physics = real understanding

Demos prove competence

Impossible to fake depth
